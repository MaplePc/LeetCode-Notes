Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

For example,
"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" is a palindrome.
"race a car" is not a palindrome.

Note:
Have you consider that the string might be empty? This is a good question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.
========================================
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
        final int len = s.length();
		int l = 0;
		int r = len - 1;
		final int DIFF = 'a' - 'A';
		while (l < r) {
			char c;
			while (l < r && !(((c = s.charAt(l)) >= 'a' && c <= 'z' || c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z' || c >= '0' && c <= '9')))
				l++;
			while (l < r && !(((c = s.charAt(r)) >= 'a' && c <= 'z' || c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z' || c >= '0' && c <= '9')))
				r--;
			if (l >= r)
				return true;
			c = s.charAt(l);
			char c2 = s.charAt(r);
			int diff = c - c2;
			if (diff != 0 && (Math.min(c, c2) <= '9' || diff != DIFF && diff != -DIFF))
				return false;
			l++;
			r--;
		}
		return true;
    }
}
//98%
